# jQuery-sequencer
Lightweight jQuery plugin that allows you to create a scroll-scrubbing "video" clip from an image sequence.

# Requirements
To use this you first need an image sequence. An image sequence is basically just a video clip split into many still images. (Many video editors allow you to export your clip like this). This plugin expects images in a given folder to be named `<nr>.<ext> (ie. 0.jpg)`, and start at 0. Furthermore, you would want to position your container element as fixed, with a set height. This means you can easily decide how far you would like the user to scroll, in order to navigate the clip.

Ìƒ You would also most likely want to use a preloader for this (unless you're running your site inside a super fast internal network environment), as the browser will send GET requests for each image the plugin pulls in. I've used this one: https://github.com/htmlhero/jQuery.preload and it works quite well.~

The plugin now does its own preloading.

# Usage
## Include it
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-sequencer.min.js"></script>
```

## Slap it on a container of choice
```
$("#elem").sequencer([options], [callback]);
```

## Create an image tag
The plugin expects this tag to have a class called "sequencer". The image you show here will be your first frame.
```
<img class="sequencer" src="./images/0.jpg">
```

## Parameters (all required)
- `options.count` The amount of images you want to show
- `options.path` The path to your images
- `options.ext` The file extension of your images
- `callback` Callback function will be called once the preloader is done fetching images
